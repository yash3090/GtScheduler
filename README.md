# Heroku WebApp - GT Scheduler
Automated schedule creation for students by scraping class registration website, rate my professor for professor ratings, and course critique for professor GPA's to create the best schedules for students with no conflicts and recitations being synced automatically based on professor rating and avg GPA. Students can enter additional restrictions based on seats available in the course, time restrictions, and excluding certain sections of courses.
